# Sparkify
---
This repository contains the work done for my capstone project in the Udacity - Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project, I will perform some analysis and build the machine learning model based on the provided data from Sparkify to predict the churn rate of users. 

Sparkify is a fictional online music application that provide music service like Spotify... The churn rate prediction is an interesting and common task for a data scientist to help entrepreneurs make decisions on some aspects that can improve their business.
