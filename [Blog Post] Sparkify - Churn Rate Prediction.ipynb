    "There are many online apps that allow us to listen to our favorite songs. And it's really common among these apps to split between free tier and paid. Since the users from both tiers could stop using the app for many reasons, the analysis and prediction of which user will stop using the service should be helpful and necessary for running business. That also helps entrepreneurs decide to actively launch the appropriate discounts/promotions for these specific users before they leave. And as the result of that, we could say predictive analysis plays extremely crucial role in business and data science could be a great aspect to concern.\n",

And particularly in this project, I have chosen a medium-sized data to implement some analysis and build the machine learning model based on the provided data to predict the churn rate of users. The churn rate prediction is an interesting and common task for a data scientist to help entrepreneurs make decisions on some aspects that can improve their business."
